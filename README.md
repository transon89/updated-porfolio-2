Click on this link to view my porfolio https://transon89.github.io/updated-porfolio-2/.

## Quick overview: 

I have completed more than half of the bootcamp coding class at VU. We are basically building upon our learnings to update the porfolio's page. 
We have learned the back end side of the server by knowing MYSQL. I've learned how to create tables and adding values to it. In addition, we have learned node.js and how to utilize it with the database on mySQL. On project 2, the class was asked to implement what we have learned so far in the class and create a website based on that. This is what my new porfolio's page is based upon.
